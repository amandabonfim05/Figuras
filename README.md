# 📐 Geometry Calculator

This project is a Java application that calculates the perimeter and area of geometric shapes.  
It was developed as a learning exercise to practice programming logic, object-oriented concepts, and mathematical applications in software development.  

---

## 📖 Overview
The application supports calculations for:
- Squares  
- Rectangles  
- Circles  
- Triangles  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Java   

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Apply software engineering concepts in Java  
- Automate calculations of geometric figures  
- Strengthen knowledge of algorithms, classes, and methods  

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add support for additional geometric shapes  
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI)  
- Provide input validation and error handling  
- Allow saving calculation history
